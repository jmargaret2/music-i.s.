%\lettrine[lines=2, lhang=0.33, loversize=0.1]{T}he purpose of this document is to %provide you with a template for typesetting your IS using %\LaTeX\index{LaTeX@\LaTeX}. \lt is very similar to HTML in the sense that it is a %markup language. What does this mean? Well, basically it means you need only enter %the commands for structuring your IS, i.e., identify chapters, sections, %subsections, equations, quotes, etc. You do not need to worry about any of the %formatting. The  \texttt{woosterthesis} class takes care of all of the formatting.
